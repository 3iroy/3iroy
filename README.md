## Purpose

It is an application showing the basic stats of each NBA player for regular seasons from 1999 till 2020 using both bar plot and table. The bar plot can show the variation of one single basic stat of a single player through his career in one team, while the table shows all the basic stats for that player through his career in one team. Furthermore, if users want to look at average stats of any player, they are able to select the check box and view it in the table tab. 

## Data

I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle. The original dataset includes 49 Leagues, over 11K players details & stats per Season from 1999-2020, containing player details: Birth Date, Height, Weight, Nationality, High School and stats per season: Scoring Stats, Free Throws, Rebounds, Blocks, Assists, Minutes, Games etc.
The dataset after filtered contains basic information of the players like season, team, name and basic stats like points, assists, field goal made, three-pointer attempt, personal foul etc.
